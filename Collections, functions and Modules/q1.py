# What is List? How will you reverse a list? 

# In Python, a list is a versatile data structure used to store a collection of items.
# Lists can contain elements of different data types, and they are mutable,
# meaning you can change their contents after they are created.


list1=["1","2","3","4","5"]

# r=list1[::-1]

list1.reverse()

print(list1)
